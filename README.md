# Data_Structures_Algorithms
This repository covers the basic concepts in data structures and algorithms in java language

A data structure is a collection of data items in a memory of a running program that are organized in some fashion that allows items to be stored and retrieved by some fixed methods.

An algorithm is a logical sequence of discrete steps that describes a complete solution to a given problem commutable in a finite amount of time and space.


Data structures covered:
list
stack
queue
tree
binary tree
hash table

Other data structures:

many different types of trees
many different types of graphs
